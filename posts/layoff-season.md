While everyone is preparing for Thanksgiving, I am yet again, dusting off my resume and reaching out to recruiters. The difference this year is, that I'm less stressed and felt prepared for a potential layoff. Getting the boot is never easy and is bound to happen. Here are some signs that a layoff is coming and some tips on how to be prepared.

## Potential Signs for Trouble Looming

### Roadmap Planning
No clear understanding of what to work on is really bad. There really isn't an excuse for it. Delays in deciding what projects to take on don't provide transparency or trust.

### Recent Merger
Did your company just get acquired or merged with your parent company? If so, chances are leadership will look to consider what resources need to be trimmed or not needed. On the other hand leadership may want to pump the acquiree with more resources and promote product growth. Hence whey it is vital that you pay attention to the reason for the merge.

### Insufficient Growth from a Profit or KPI
Get an understanding of how your company measures success. If you understand the data behind the metrics, the more you can see how the company is doing on your own terms.

### Sudden Changes In Projects
If a company wants to sunset a project without ringing any bells, then you may see a slowdown in innovation and improvements. I've been on a team placed on hold and focused on building tests on existing components. This was a means to keep us "busy" while decisions around the project were made.


## Be Prepared

### Pay attention to layoff trends
After the pandemic we saw larger companies launch waves of layoffs. This was a way to handle unsustainable growth, and smaller companies followed this decision. Hence it became a trend. Keep close eye on what is going on in your professional network. LinkedIn and Reddit are good sources to get a sense of what is happening in tech.

### Have a Side Project
Having a side project never hurts. Whether it is for passive income or just for learning purposes, keeping projects ready to show off helps during interviews. This gives you something to show offto others. By doing this you can speak on issues that have popped up, your architectural decisions, and even how you integrated third-party services.

### Talk to recruiters for feelers
Instead of automatically declining recruiters, have a conversation. Hear them out and learn about the roles they are offering. Be honest and mention that you are not looking currently (if this is the case). You never know when circumstances change, so it is good to build those professional connections.

### Carve out time to learn at work
If your company offers a learning platform like [Udemy Pro](https://business-support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/9248706921879-What-is-Udemy-Business-Pro-) or [LinkedIn Learning](https://learning.linkedin.com/cx/get-started), take advantage of this. Learn a new language, get a certification, or even take up some soft skill courses. Build on your skills for your current role and for future opportunities.

### Providing Value
Providing value to your company doesn't just mean what product you build. You can also promote cultural changes. Find ways that make working together easier. Establish protocols or means of communication that promote accountability, communication, and teamwork. By being a strong leader you are less likely to be selected for layoffs.
